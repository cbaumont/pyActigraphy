    study.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: array-like
        Activity time series.
    win_size: int, optional
        Number of consecutive zero epochs needed to initiate an off-wrist
        period.
        Default value is 60.
    activity_threshold: int, optional
        Activity equal or above this threshold is considered nonzero.
        Default value is 0.
    spike_threshold: int, optional
        One epoch of activity at or above this threshold will restart counting
        of consecutive zero epochs, and the window will not be considered
        'off-wrist'.
        Default is 100.
    spike_max_nr: int, optional
        Maximum allowable number of nonzero epochs occuring during the
        window of consecutive zeros to consider the window as "off-wrist".
        Default value is 2.

    Return
    ----------
    mask : np.narray
        Binary time series containing the estimated nonwear/wear periods (0/1).

    # Excerpt from Choi et al.:
    # The recommended elements in the new algorithm are as follows:
    # 1) zero-count threshold during a nonwear time interval,
    # 2) 90-min time window for consecutive zero or nonzero counts, and
    # 3) allowance of a 2-min interval of nonzero counts with upstream or
    # downstream 30-min consecutive zero-count windows for artifactual movement
    # detection.

    # Transform the data to do the following:
    # Create 0's when the data is <= activity_threshold and > spike_stoplevel
    # Create 1's when the data is > activity_threshold and < spike_stoplevel
    # Create 1 more than the spike_tolerance when data > spike_tolerance

    # data_series = pd.Series(
    #     np.where(
    #         data <= activity_threshold, 0, np.where(
    #             (data > activity_threshold) & (data < spike_stoplevel),
    #             1,
    #             spike_tolerance+1

    #     )

    # # Get the rolling sum of the previous consecutive epochs of length
    # "minlength". The default for choi is 90 epochs.

    # # The choi algorithm has another criteria where any spikes in activity
    # (i.e., nonzero epochs) must have a certain number of consecutive zero
    # epochs prior and after without any nonzero epochs
    # # We will create another data series, with binary 0's and 1's where 1 is
    # nonzero activity. Currently, the 'data_series' variable, contains the
